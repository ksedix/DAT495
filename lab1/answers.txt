[60]
     - To land on a first estimate cutoffvalue it was helpful to compare the time
       for the inital quicksort algorithm and the time for the insertion algorithm.
       There's a noticable difference, Insertion sort has better time than quicksort
       on n=10, n=30 and starts to have worse time starting from n=100.

       Which gava us the idea for a suitable cutoffvalue being somewhere between
       30 and 100. Wanting a cutoffvalue that gives us a compromise of being fast
       for small arrays while being fast for bigger arrays we choose to try values
       around 50. After trial and error settling on 60 where going bigger gave us a
       larger time for smaller arrays while giving us a slight time decrease for larger
       arrays and going smaller doing the opposite. Â±60 becoming the final cutoffvalue.
